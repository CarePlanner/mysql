(Forked from https://github.com/docker-library/mysql)

This version of the standard docker mysql image includes support for importing a db dump from an S3 bucket. Just pass the following environment values at runtime:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYYYY
$MYSQL_S3_DUMP=s3://my-bucket/prefix/mydump.sql.gz
```

It also supports adding a user and privileges for datadog. Just set the password as an environment variable (the same password must be given to the datadog agent):

```
DATADOG_PASSWORD=ZZZZZZ
```
